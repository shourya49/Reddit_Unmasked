I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFTI see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses.

But if you want to become more ""conventionally attractive"", here are some of my suggestions. Just personal opinions, take them or leave them.Do away with glasses - Have you considered contacts? If not you should look into it. Or lasik although that's a bit pricy (and scary to some). I did it and was the best decision ever.Work out - make sure to get enough protein and look into creatine as wellI'd recommend losing weight though cardio & eating healthier, as well as build muscle though bench and squats. Don't forget to stretch too since you can injure yourself! And get a gym rat to spot you. Once you start losing weight you'll see your face slim down as wellhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BQ3QVQJ9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULZF5HC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Fashion - Uniqlo is a good start, but you gotta dress well in Uniqlohttps://www.instagram.com/steelojeem/reel/C_oENHCPkft(If you're in Japan just buy them there it's cheaper haha)I wouldn't recommend you wearing anime related items if you're trying to be ""conventionally attractive"". Make it something very subtle, like a tiny totoro tattoo on your wrist, or a ring which doesn't shout ANIMEEEEE! Also if someone asks your about it you can elaborate on your interest, but keep it short and succinct so you don't nerd out until you know they are interested in learning more.If you can afford it, go one layer above and try Coshttps://www.cos.com/en_usd/men.htmlEyebrows - Go get your brows done at an Indian threading place. Take a picture of it, and try to recreate it via shaver belowhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079M8D8Y9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Skincare - You seem to be on the oily side like me.

They surveyed the island, took biological records of the wildlife, and to an extent modernized Taiwan. I was surprised to see how a sizable portion of Taiwan’s natural history museum were contributions by Japanese scientists when I went to Taipei.However, I think it’s about how people in Taiwan perceive Japanese occupation which is relevant. This actually isn’t entirely about what Japan did in Taiwan, but what came after. The kuomintang led nationalist government committed mass murder (known as the 228 incident), which made those who lived through both eras look back fondly at the era of Japanese occupation.I’m not trying to justify colonialism, but feel that the atrocities by the nationalism government seems to have painted a (relatively) positive light of the Japanese occupation in the eyes of the elders. I am curious to hear a Taiwanese persons’ perspective on this though, because my understanding is that the occupying japanese forces also did their fair share of inhumane acts during the occupation.",[],2024-04-19T15:13:31+00:00,-1,-1,0,"{'postTitle': '[deleted by user]', 'postLink': 'https://www.reddit.com', 'postAuthor': None, 'postSubreddit': 'r/AskHistorians'}"

If you're putting up Japanese artwork as art and is respecting it, I doubt any Japanese person will take offense. But making some cheap piece of clothing and branding it as ""kimono"" since it will sell better is disrespectful in my eyes.I think the keyword here is ""authenticity"" and ""respect"". As long as one adopts a culture with these in mind, there is nothing wrong with it. But it's ultimately up to those who belong in the original culture to decide if these standards are being met. Obviously there is no ""singular hive mind of Japanese consciousness"", and the answer will depend from person to person. As Japan becomes more racially/culturally diverse (albeit slower than most other nations), these definitions will shift. A Ukrainian born woman (ethnically entirely white European) just became Ms. Japan, which led to alot of backlash. Personally I think this is a welcoming change as Japan embraces diversity, especially as she is much more culturally Japanese than most ethnically Japanese people. I feel Japan should redefine what it means to be Japanese, and cultural symbols like her or Osaka Naomi, Rui Hachimura, are pushing the envelope in a positive way.And to answer your question:Traditionally (pre industrial revolution) kimonos were worn by people of different social class for a variety of occasions. Kimono actually means ""clothes"", which includes sub categories such as samui (work clothes) or yukata (summer clothes). There's also a word for western clothes (洋服), which is what most people wear these days.In modern era, there are certain occasions you are more likely to see it (e.g. summer festivals, tea ceremony, black tie events), but it's not uncommon to see people wearing kimono on the streets any time of the year.

I like the +- idea instead of doing it 5/5. It feels more intuitive. Yeah, I felt that there are times it gets revised more than once. For instance, you bought a PS5, loved it for the first few weeks, but stopped playing with it once the novelty wore off. In that case, the line chart would go up, then down. I feel that there is a threshold on the price point people care about (around $50?), and the frequency people want to track purchases (every two weeks?).

Hope you don’t get laid off, but happy to provide my insight. I’m not a professional trader but have made 300% gains this past month. Here’s what I’m doing:Now that even Mckinsey is saying economic recovery will take until Q4, a lot of put options are starting to get expensive. It’s what people would call it “priced in”, since it’s no secret we’ll likely see a recession. With that being said I’ll still buy some puts.I’d buy put options on days when the market is making a rebound. Considering we went down like crazy today, I foresee a temporary bounce back tomorrow. I bought some apple, cvs, Walmart stocks today, and will sell them tomorrow hopefully around +4%. With that money, I intend to buy some call options. Which ones? Not entirely sure but thinking of following.SPY is a safe bet. If the economy goes down long term, so will SPY put options.Avoid airlines, as there’s been conversations of bail outs. If MGM or Wynn recovers a lot tomorrow (8%+) I’ll buy mid term (3 month) puts there.Don’t know enough about oil so won’t gamble thereThink I missed the boat on VIX so not touching that too.Until when will I hold them? Probably will sell 1/2 in 2 weeks, the rest in 4 weeks. I know holding puts overnight or over weekends are a bad idea normally, but now that puts are so high in demand, I feel like holding them for a longer period is better than keeping on buying shorter puts. Even considering the value depreciation as it get closed to expiry date. (Not an expert but has worked for me so far).Why 2 weeks and 4 weeks? I want to play it safe. China has recovered from covid19 but people aren’t fully back to work yet. I have friends on the ground who own manufacturing companies and that’s their information. So earliest China is back full capacity is 2 weeks from now. Should be back to capacity in 4 weeks. Will the market keep on going down until end of Q3? Possibly. But I’ve made enough money and I don’t see a reason to take more risks.
